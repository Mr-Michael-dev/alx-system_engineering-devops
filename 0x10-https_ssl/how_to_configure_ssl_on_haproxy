*Steps to get your domain serving over HTTPS:*

*1. Generating your SSL Certificate from Certbot:*

_*(I) Install Certbot:*_ 
   - sudo apt update && apt upgrade 
   - sudo apt install certbot

_*(II) Generate your SSL certificate:*_ 

   - sudo service haproxy stop
   - sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d www.example.tech
 
 *:: Follow prompts and you'll have your cert ready*

*2. Configuring haproxy with your certificate*

_*(I) Make a combination file of your certificate and private key*_

  - cd /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.tech/
  - cat fullchain.pem privkey.pem > www.example.tech.pem

*:: Now you have a combination of your certificate and private key*

_*(II) Add the file in your haproxy.cfg file*_

  - open /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg with a text editor.
  - add the following line in your *fronted* section in your file: 

_*bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.tech/www.example.tech.pem*_

  - lastly, add the following line in the 'global' section of the configuration file: 
 _*tune.ssl.default-dh-param 2048*_

*3. Restart HAProxy service*

  - sudo service haproxy restart


*::: That's it! Your site will now serve https*


*Ps: If you want to redirect http traffic to https, add the following line in the backend section of the _haproxy.cfg_ file:*

_*redirect scheme https if !{ ssl_fc }*_


*:::: ALL DONE!*
